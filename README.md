# motion-detector
This is basically a script which detects the motion of any object.
I have used various packages and libraries like pandas ,and openCV ,datatime etc.
This script helps us to capture the images continiously and as i have used the concept of video capture and the loops so it will convert the
fetched collection of images into the videos and i have used the rectangle boundation so as to highlight the detected object.
I have also used the dataframes so as to get the timing of when the object is get detected  and with the help of pandas i have created the 
csv file and put the info.related to the timing inside it .
